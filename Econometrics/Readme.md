# **Advanced Regression Techniques used in Econometrics**
#### Implementations in a Real-World Dataset 
## Contents
This mainly contains some of advanced regression techniques that are taught in our econometrics course and I have tried to implement some of these into my present work on a simple real world data. These will mainly take care of the following topics:


1. Data Cleaning Details
2. Some simple EDA
3. **Multicollinearity** : Detection and Removal
4. Categorical Variables Treatment
5. **Heteroskedasticity** : Detection and Removal
6. **Endogeneity** : Detection and Removal
